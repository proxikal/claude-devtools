/**
 * Shared type definitions - re-exports types from main process for use in renderer.
 *
 * This module provides a stable import path (@shared/types) for types that
 * are shared between main and renderer processes, allowing proper boundary
 * separation while maintaining type safety.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import type { Session, Chunk, ParsedMessage } from '@shared/types';
 */
